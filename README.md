# Atrial Fibrillation Detection
Data Science Project - Time Series &amp; Data Mining

## Introduction

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can detect the presence of atrial fibrillation (AF) in RR intervals of electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. AF is a type of irregular heartbeat, or arrhythmia, that originates in the upper chambers of the heart (the atria). In AF, the atria beat irregularly and rapidly, which can cause poor blood flow to the body and increase the risk of blood clots, stroke, heart failure, and other cardiovascular complications. Although AF is a common cause of many dangerous cardiovascular complications, it can be very difficult to detect, requiring tedious manual works. AFs are very short in the ECG signals and there are a lot of noises in the signals themselves. Therefore, an automatic early AF detection is crucial for effective treatment.
